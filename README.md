# sidebarHandler
This is my solution for a responsive sidebar that is resizable and has css transitions that do not rely on setting a max-width transition. 

Most solutions I have seen for this rely on applying the transition effect to max-width. This leads to unpredictable behavior since you need to set a max-width much larger than you would ever need. I'm mostly saving this for myself to use as boiler plate code since I often need resizable sidebars for tools I make at work, but hopefully this can help someone else.
